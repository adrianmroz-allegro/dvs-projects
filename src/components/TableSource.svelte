		Estimates of people (millions) currently on land that may be exposed to permanent inundation or
		annual flooding after projected (median and 90% CI) sea-level rise by the given year.
	</p>

	<p>
		Marginal increases in exposure from the contemporary baseline are included as well. Population
		data from 2010 was used, when the estimated global total of population was roughly 6800 million.
	</p>
	<p>Sea-level projections:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			K14 model - is a probabilistic projection, assumes relatively stable Antarctic ice sheets
		</li>
		<li>
			K17 model - is not probabilistic and emphasizes the possibility of more rapid sea-level rise
			because of unstable ice-sheet dynamics
		</li>
	</ul>
